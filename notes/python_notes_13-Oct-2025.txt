List comprehension: 
A simple way of creating python list from another iterable (like another list or string or tuple or range)

syntax: [<expression> <for declaration> <condition>]

Example 1: Creating list b using items of list a
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [item for item in a]
print(b)

Example 2: Creating list b using items of list a but including only even numbers
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [item for item in a if a%2==0]
print(b)
