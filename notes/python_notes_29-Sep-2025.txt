Items covered : 
1) Path environment variable in detail
2) executing python from any windows location
3) pycharm download and installation
(https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)
4) pycharm : run a python script
5) pycharm : debug a python script using debug point

Notes: 

1) Whenever you type any command in command prompt, it checks for that command in the PATH environment variable folder entries
  a) if that command you type is available in those folders, it will execute that command
  b) if the command is not available with PATH folder entries, but available in current working directory, it will execute 
  c) if the command is not available with PATH folder entries or in the current working directory, it will throw an error like 
	'command' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
	operable program or batch file.

2) Understanding python installation folder when python downloaded from windows store 
	a) Where did the python installation happen? (in my case)
	C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_3.13.2032.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\
	b) But setting path to this location to this error, is not launching python with error 
      "Access is denied"
	c) So copy the contents of this folder to another location in C drive or D drive where you have write access.
	d) I have copied contents 
		FROM C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_3.13.2032.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\
		TO   D:\softwares\python-3.13
	e) Then included "D:\softwares\python-3.13" in the PATH environment variable	
	f) Open new command prompt and typed python and it worked

3) Alternative way for setting path for python
 (if you dont want to copy the installation contents to another location):
	a) Understanding Home Directory: 
 	   C:\Users\Jagadeesh Verri\
	b) Locate AppData(Hidden Folder) inside home directory
	   C:\Users\Jagadeesh Verri\AppData\
	c) Inside AppData follow the below path and look for python folder
	   C:\Users\Jagadeesh Verri\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\
	d) Locate a folder starting with PythonSoftwareFoundation
	   in my case : PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0
	e) Include this folder where python.exe is available in the PATH environment variable
	   C:\Users\Jagadeesh Verri\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0	
	f) Launch a new shell and test it by typing python in command prompt

3) To execute python script use 
	python script_name.py
	Example: 
	python D:\work\bigdata\sep_2025_batch\scripts\welcome.py
